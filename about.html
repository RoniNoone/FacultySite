    <p>I’m a highly technical, active, resourceful, problem-solver who enjoys being creative and connecting with people. I thrive off reaching goals. </p>
    <h3>I’m a Teacher </h3>
    <p>Besides teaching full-time as an Assistant Professor, I always volunteer for and accept any chance to present. Training is a passion of mine. I love sharing knowledge and have taught a range of topics from motivational soft-skills to technical how-tos. I have earned a Master of Science in Instructional Technology and a Bachelor of Business Administration in Management Informations Systems.</p>
    <h3>I’m an Entrepreneur </h3>
    <p>In my 15+ year career, I’ve developed websites and multimedia projects for businesses and academia, instructed and developed curriculum at the college level, created and managed an annual 300-person event, and provided marketing solutions to franchise owners. </p>
    <h3>I’m a Geek </h3>
    <p>Listing software proficiencies seems silly to me. I have yet to meet an online or multimedia technology I couldn’t figure out. From graphics programs to web and programming languages, even video editing, I enjoy being creative and learning new tools. </p>
    <h3>I’m a Storyteller </h3>
    <p>Blogging professionally, I have worked with a variety of brands including Kellogg, ALDI, The Laughing Cow, Liberty Mutual, HumanaVitality, Weight Watchers, Kraft, Vitalicious, Subway, Johns Hopkins University, Quaker, Nutrilite, and Pom. Many media outlets have also featured my story, including CNN, the Today show, Inside Edition, Ladies Home Journal, Everyday Health, Woman’s World, Woman’s Day, and Wired. </p>
    <h3>I’m a Motivator </h3>
    <p>I changed the course of my life by losing 70-pounds in 2005. I blogged the entire journey from couch potato to reluctant exerciser to marathoner to CrossFitter. My mission is to inspire and motivate people to reach their own goals, and in 2018 I became a certified personal trainer. </p>
    <h3>I’m an Adventurer </h3>
    <p>Always exploring, I crave new experiences, and I thrive on change and challenges.</p>
